			<strong>Undergraduate Admission Requirement</strong><BR><BR>Also known as ECMAScript,[6] is a prototype-based, object-oriented[7] scripting language that is dynamic, weakly typed and has first-class functions. It is also considered a functional programming language[1] like Scheme and OCaml because it has closures and supports higher-order functions.[8]
			<br><br>

			JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript language standard and is primarily used in the form of client-side JavaScript, implemented as part of a web browser in order to provide enhanced user interfaces and dynamic websites. This enables programmatic access to computational objects within a host environment.  <BR><BR>
         <strong>Undergraduate Graduation Requirement</strong><BR><BR>
			JavaScript's use in applications outside web pages—for example in PDF-documents, site-specific browsers and desktop widgets—is also significant. Newer and faster Javascript VMs and frameworks built upon them (notably Node.js) have also increased the popularity of Javascript for server-side web apps.
			<br><br>
			JavaScript uses syntax influenced by that of C. JavaScript copies many names and naming conventions from Java, but the two languages are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The key design principles within JavaScript are taken from the Self and Scheme programming languages.[9]

            (the look and formatting) of a document written in a markup language. Its most common application is to style web pages written in
            HTML and XHTML, but the language can also be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.

			 <strong><u>Level 200 Courses</u></strong><BR><BR>
			CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content (written in HTML or a similar markup language)
            from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts.[1] This separation can improve
             content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,<BR><BR>
              <strong><u>Level 300 Courses</u></strong><BR><BR>
             enable multiple pages to share formatting, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content
             (such as by allowing for tableless web design). CSS can also allow the same markup page to be presented in
             different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (when read out by a <BR><BR>
              <strong><u>Level 400 Courses</u></strong><BR><BR>
             speech-based browser or screen reader) and on Braille-based, tactile devices. While the author of a document
             typically links that document to a CSS style sheet, readers can use a different style sheet, perhaps one on
             their own computer, to override the one the author has specified.

			jQuery is free, open source software, dual-licensed under the MIT License and the GNU General Public License, Version 2.[4] jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plugins on top of the JavaScript library. Using these facilities, developers are able to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. This contributes to the creation of powerful and dynamic web pages.

			Microsoft and Nokia have announced plans to bundle jQuery on their platforms,[5] Microsoft adopting it initially within Visual Studio[6] for use within Microsoft's ASP.NET AJAX framework and ASP.NET MVC Framework while Nokia has integrated it into their Web Run-Time widget development platform.[7] jQuery has also been used in MediaWiki since version 1.16.[8]
